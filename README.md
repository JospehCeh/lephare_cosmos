Repo to be used as a submodule for my PhotoZ_PhD main repository.
This will contain config files and data to use the COSMOS catalogue in LePhare++,
with the aim to combine this and FORS2-derived SED templates to improve photo-z estimation.

This, ultimately to pave the way for good photo-z for Rubin-LSST/DESC science projects.
